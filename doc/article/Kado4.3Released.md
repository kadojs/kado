# Kado 4.3 Released
*By Bryan Tong 10/11/22*

Kado 4.3 has been released since February 2022 and stabilizes the big additions
made in Kado 4.2.

Most of the Kado 4.3 features and changes come from real life testing and
production feedback. This release focuses on consistent error handling and
stability in public.
