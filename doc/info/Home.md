```
npm install kado
```
Collection of JavaScript Framework Libraries for Node.js

## Quick Hello Server

Place the following code into an empty JavaScript file, example: `app.js`.
```js
'use strict'
// import kado
const kado = require('kado')
// create application
const app = kado.getInstance()
// create a webserver
const http = new kado.HyperText.HyperTextServer()
// register the webserver
app.http.addEngine('http', http.createServer(app.router))
// register a route
app.get('/', (req, res) => { res.end('Hello') })
// start the application and listen
app.start().then(() => app.listen())
```
After saving the file, execute the code by running the following command from
the same folder as the JavaScript file.
```
node app
```
Once the command has executed, a web server that says "Hello" will be available
on port `3000` of your local machine, example: `http://localhost:3000`.

## Get Started with our Guides

Our guides provide a step by step experience to learn how to use Kado to go from
saying "Hello" on a web port to writing a working administration panel. Once
these guides are completed, building websites and applications using Kado should
feel second nature. Each guide below is accompanied by a link to the full guide
as well as a short description of what each guide provides.

* [Getting Started](../guide/GettingStarted.md) - Get started using Kado
and create a simple project that says "Hello" via HTTP on localhost port 3000.
* [HelloWorld](../guide/HelloWorld.md) - Building upon the
[GettingStarted](../guide/GettingStarted.md) guide, this guide will
introduce rendering and templates that say "Hello World" with HTML.
* [Make a Simple Website](../guide/MakeSimpleWebsite.md) - Continuing
from the [HelloWorld](../guide/HelloWorld.md) guide we add partials,
static file serving, CSS, and navigation to create a simple working website.
* [Build an Admin Panel](../guide/BuildAdminPanel.md) - Now with
[Make a Simple Website](../guide/MakeSimpleWebsite.md) complete, we
continue to explore how to build an administration panel on top of our simple
website.
* [Database Work Flows](../guide/DatabaseWorkFlow.md) - With a working
[Admin Panel](../guide/BuildAdminPanel.md) the next step is to setup a
connection to a database so we can store the data created by the application.
* [Working With Email](../guide/WorkingWithEmail.md) - Explore sending
emails using the Kado provided libraries and connecting to an email server.
* [Views and Rendering](../guide/ViewsRendering.md) - Everything you need
to know about the Kado view system and how to render views.
* [Writing Tests](../guide/WritingTests.md) - Write tests against your
application easily using the provided Kado library.
