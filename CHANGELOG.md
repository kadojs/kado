### 4.3.2
*Released 7/7/21*

* Removed index of Session data on the SessionStoreModel

### 4.3.1
*Released 7/5/21*
* Session.set() now saves automatically and returns a promise that should be
awaited. IN the event multiple session sets are going to happen in the same
method it is advised to use `{ save: false }` as a third option to
`Session.set()` then call `Session.save()` and await the promise at the end.
This is meant to make sure that session saving is not implied to be automatic.
It should be explicit and handled like any other database transaction. [!294](https://git.nullivex.com/kado/kado/-/merge_requests/294)

### 4.2.1
*Released 5/7/20*
* Add MariaDB support.
* Add notify support for showing notifications to end users, such as a save
being successful. This is done with `req.notify('some message')` which defaults
to a level of `ok` or success, if there is an error
`req.notify(new Error('some Error'))` sending an error object will automatically
set a level of 'error' or failure. Lastly, custom levels support is done through
class names such as:
```js
class MyWarning extends Error {}
req.notify(new MyWarning('something is broken'))
```
NOTE: Sessions must be enabled for notifications to be saved.
In order to show notifications they are made available through the
`req.locals._session._notify` variable. Here is a template example:
```html
{{#_notify}}<div class="notify notify-{{level}">{{message}}</div>{{/_notify}}
```
* Add more core `FS` modules into the `FileSystem` library to add more
convenience.
* Various fixes to documentation.

* Add new QueryCache.js for caching queries from a database in a database.
* Add new Schema.js for building tables for databases.
* Validate.isType upgraded to be more consistent and predictable.
* Parser adds `requestBody` parser to assist with input decoding.
* Router adds `res.json()` for JSON output.
* Router adds `res.redirect()` for location changes.
* Router adds `res.sendFile()` for sending files.
* Session adds `SessionStoreSQL` for SQL backed sessions from databases.
* Cluster adds `dev` mode and `disableMaster` to help with running in single
process mode.
* Cluster now automatically establishes worker counts unless told otherwise.
* Commands can now return undefined as a valid exit value
* Fix to only setup cluster master when available.
* Fix to app startup when commands are present.
* HyperTextServer now accepts an array of hosts to listen on.
* Cluster no longer recycles workers from reaching a maxConnection ceiling by
default.
* Fix to properly close database connections on stop.
* Add `HyperText.Proxy` to HyperText.js which provides an HTTP reverse proxy.
* Make the testing of extended types more robust, to ensure extension of a
proper parent.
* Fix the promise chain when starting and stopping connect systems from
Application.

### 4.1.0
*Released 3/9/2020*
* Add new Mime.js library for looking up file types from extensions.
* Add new ETag.js library for generating ETag headers for cache protection.
* Implement the Mime.js in the included HyperText static server.
* Implement the ETag.js in the included HyperText server.
* Multiple fixes and changes to the documents.
* Add new methods to the Parser library.

### 4.0.1
*Released 2/20/2020*
* Fix the PathExp system to properly handle matching against multiple inputs.

### 4.0.0
*Released 2/20/2020*
* BREAKING CHANGES, not compatible with Kado 3.x out of the box, see
https://kado.org/content/upgrading-4.x for more.
* No interfaces a provided by default.
* No frameworks are provided by default.
* Interface startup is now handled in user space.
* Redesign startup API this means exposing more of the interface start process
 into user space so that the application itself can define routes etc from the
 ground up, drop the default modules and move them into a kado-ui pack that
 comes with an admin panel and simple content management and blog publishing.
 This should help drop the weight of the core down but more importantly give
 Kado the true building block feel it should have came with all along. This
 will also allow Kado to come with even less packages and continue to provide
 the same consistent working environment. So what does this mean?
 * Expose interface startup through a kado.js file in the application the same
 way modules are handled.
 * Remove the default modules other than the kado module. This will remove
 the addons that must be built and make installation more global along with
 giving the user more choices over how to build the application.
 * Continue to abstract from actually being a web engine and focus on being a
 programming organization engine. We didnt quite know or understand this at the
 beginning, however Kado is more about organizing code.
 * Write upgrade documentation on conversion from Kado 3.x to Kado 4.x which
 will mostly involve adding to a kado.js within the application to restore
 default routing functionality.
 * No longer start two interfaces by default, move to a single interface model.
 Using two interfaces just served to complicate all matters, using a single
 interface with enhanced routing makes the most sense. In instances where the
 panels need to be split in however many places this can be done by simply,
 starting multiple instances and using webserver rules to deny or allow urls.

### 3.10.6
*Released 2/12/2020*
* This is the more than likely the last release before Kado 4.0 is released.
* A warning is due now that Kado 4 will be complete incompatible with Kado 3 as
Kado 4.0 fully realizes ES6. For the future, Kado 3 will continue to be
maintained within the same repository as Kado 4 in a separate branch. However
due to limitations on NPM, Kado 3 versions will be released as the kado-legacy
package.
* A further warning that Kado 4 will be changing from an MIT license to Lesser
GPL Version 3+ please plan accordingly!

  * bcrypt       ^3.0.6  →   ^3.0.7
  * commander    ^4.0.0  →   ^4.0.1

### 3.10.0
*Released 11/12/2019*
* Add new interface configuration option `homeRouteFile` when specified this
file will be loaded in a method like `exports.home = (req,res)=>{}` where.
This allows custom definition of homepage files, when this route does not
exist, the system will load the canned homepage routes and views.

### 3.9.6
*Released 11/10/2019*
* Update to the latest dependencies and change help handling on CLI scripts
for modules and generation template.

### 3.9.5
*Released 10/12/2019*
* The environment variable `BUNDLE` can now be set to `false` to disable
the auto bundling system when in development mode.

### 3.9.4
*Released 10/12/2019*
* Fix two small bugs in the Asset management system.

### 3.9.3
*Released 10/11/2019*
* Change the default content module to include the _pageTitle on static
definitions, to match the behavior of content from the database.
* Update to latest dependencies.

### 3.9.2
*Released 9/26/2019*
* `node app kado dbreload` no longer utilizes the system level mysqldump
and has internal tools to backup, dump and apply the dump to the database.
This ensures the tool works on all platforms.

### 3.9.1
*Released 9/25/2019*
* Adds new utility command `node app kado dbreload` this is a macro
command that will dump the data from your current database and then
back it up. Afterwards it will perform a forced sequelize sync and finally
re-apply the dumped data. This is useful for database changes when products
are pre-release and the data set is not a priority. For production instances
using sequelize migrations is highly recommended.

### 3.9.0
*Released 9/25/2019*
* Content system now reads configuration for static content object
which contains {'uri': {templateFile: 'foo.html'}}. This allows
applications to have static content, for terms of service, policy pages,
etc. It also allows these pages to exist outside of the database, if they
are intended to come with the project at the beginning this makes much
more sense.
* Update to latest dependencies.

### 3.8.6
*Released 8/17/2019*
* Add Select All and Deselect All buttons to table buttons
* Update to latest dependencies.

### 3.8.5
*Released 7/18/2019*
* Update to latest dependencies.

### 3.8.4
*Released 7/3/2019*
* Update to latest dependencies.
* Use `nullivex/sequelize-datatable` to use latest packages.
* Clear all known security advisories.

### 3.8.3
*Released 5/23/2019*
* Added dates to the Changelog.
* Merge PR #6 to update default icons in admin.
* Merge PR #5 Change generated modules to use addScriptOnce properly.
* Removed accidental dependency on bootbox and clear security alerts.
* Update to latest dependencies.

### 3.8.2
*Released 4/19/2019*
* Auto bundling moved to after the interfaces have been started.
* Dev activation now fully forces Kado dev mode on when using the CLI parameter.

### 3.8.1
*Released 4/18/2019*
* Fix path selection for bundling in app context.

### 3.8.0
*Released 4/18/2019*
* More refined local entry points.
* Refinement of Webpack integration to solve dependency restrictions and find
a balance of loading and splitting. The system now creates:
  * main.js - Global elements loaded in the head tag, keep this small.
  * bundle.js - Loaded at the end of the page containing additional deps.
  * deferred.js - Loaded deferred after the bundle, extraneous dep free code.

Routes that need one off scripts will load them deferred, conditional modules
need to be loaded sync and then the enumerating scripts shall be deferred. This
removes the idea of required, extra, module, moduleExtra, local, localExtra and
compresses the build chains. Webpack is compressed into a single config chain
per interface. The bundle system now handles configuring and running Webpack.
Finally, Kado now supports applications overriding the Webpack configuration
in order to make the build chain fully customizable.

### 3.7.15
*Released 4/18/2019*
* Adjust webpack to expose jquery globally. This is temporary as the build
chain is refined. There will be a major build system overhaul in 3.8 to address
the complexity of the build chains and webpack configuration files.

### 3.7.14
*Released 4/18/2019*
* Hot fix: build chain should not use production method unless asked.

### 3.7.13
*Released 4/18/2019*
* Automatically sets environment variables using `dotenv` package, and using
`node app dev` will set `DEV=kado` automatically.
* When in dev mode Kado will now automatically bundle the local and module
chains using `node app kado bundle -l -m`
* Moves init logging into the `debug` package under `kado*`

### 3.7.12
*Released 4/18/2019*
* Change bundle system to allow multiple chains at the same time such as
`node app kado bundle -l -s -m` which is equivalent of `node app kado bundle`
* Latest dependencies.

### 3.7.11
*Released 4/15/2019*
* Fix npm complaint about `acorn` module (for some reason 
`acorn-dynamic-import@4.0.0` did not properly pull it as a dep?)
* Fix npm trying to update `babel-loader` too far (v8.x.x does not work, but
apparently satisfies `babel-loader@^7.1.5`)

### 3.7.10
*Released 4/13/2019*
* Fix issue with `addScriptOnce` and `addCssOnce` where the resources display on
the next page load.
* Correct modules to use the `addScriptOnce` methods.

### 3.7.9
*Released 4/12/2019*
* Use development mode for building by default and require either
`NODE_ENV=production` or `node app kado bundle --production` to enable complete
builds.
* Disable view cache when in development mode.
* No longer restart on .html changes with nodemon.
* There is now `npm run build` for production and `npm run bundle` as well as
`npm run postinstall` to handle development building.

### 3.7.8
*Released 4/12/2019*
* Bug fix to windows paths generated during build process.

### 3.7.7
*Released 4/11/2019*
* Fix local build suites to output to the system entry folder.
* `local.js` and `localExtra.js` were not using the properly build module list.
* Break build into system, module local chains with sync and extra packs.
* Add ability to filter bundling by -s for system or -m for module.
* Enable source maps in bundles by default.
* Add `-q` to do quick builds of local only and then `-N` to skip building
source maps. See `node app kado bundle --help` for more information.

### 3.7.6
*Released 4/11/2019*
* Adding assets on page routes did not clear on render. The Asset system now has
`addCssOnce` and `addScriptOnce` these methods are cleared with each call to the
asset `allCss` and `allScript` methods.
* Adds Dynamic Connector support. The `connector` folder can now contain generic
connectors that are scanned and connected at init time.
* All connector support: dynamic, email, db are now scanned for in their
respective user space folders. Such as `projectroot/db/mongodb.js` etc.
* Includes the **StretchFS** connector as the first of the dynamic connectors.
* Changes the outlook on build chains. `Extra` chains are now meant to deferred
while maintaining the levels. Such as `local` and `module` now have
`localExtra` and `moduleExtra` these help facilitate loading extra needed
dependencies in each portion of the chain and helping to avoid duplicates.
* Moves `moment` into the required build chain to support various needs.
* Add `removeScript` and `removeCss` parameters to allow removal of system
level components in lieu of custom components or a lighter stack.

### 3.7.5
*Released 4/10/2019*
* Move bootstrap into required build chain.

### 3.7.4
*Released 4/10/2019*
* Disable performance hints by default when building, however allow them to be
enabled by passing `node app kado bundle --hints` which will complain about
large JS files and other performance issues.

### 3.7.3
*Released 4/9/2019*
* Bug fix to required bundle process now assigns jquery to
window.$, window.jQuery and window.jquery

### 3.7.2
*Released 4/9/2019*
* Add the parameters `addCss: [{}], addScript: [{}]` to each interface
declaration in order to add additional resources directly from the app config.
Each object requires the key `uri` such as `{uri: '/a.css'}` or
`addScript: [{uri: '/new.js', defer: false}]` which loads a new JS resource
synchronously (all default adds are deferred).

### 3.7.1
*Released 4/9/2019*
* Bug fixes to bundle root handling.
* Use proper app suite on post install generation.
* Start using Git tags and Github releases.
* Drop unused dependencies.
* Use parallel tersing for bundle speedups.

### 3.7.0
*Released 4/6/2019*
* Distribute Kado under the MIT license!
* Start using webpack as build system for front end.
* Split key asset groups into loading packs for accelerated and circumstantial
page loading.
* Add asset system to dynamically register and use assets from the route files.
This works with both CSS and Script tags.
* Add `KADO_USER_ROOT` process environment variable to assume user root when
available.
* Insert samples command is now `node app kado insert-samples`
* Added new utility commend `node app kado scan-modules` returns a line
delimited list of modules currently registered to the system.
* Scan modules for asset folders and include assets into build.
* Includes easy to use user space build setup. Add entry points into the app

  application.
  * `node app test somemodule` Again, `app.js` except this will only test 
    `somemodule` EG: `blog`
* The tests are now contained within the module and registered via the
  `exports.test` method of `kado.js` module file.

### 3.5.0
*Released 1/24/2019*
* Implement Profiler sub system to track queries and timing on page loads.
* Add `config.dev = true` which will enable development and print page profiling
 in the default interfaces through the template variables provided by the
 profiler.
* BREAKING: The render function has now been overloaded with an improved Kado
 provided function `render`. Backwards compatibility will be provided by using
 the existing functions. However, `res.render('blog/list',{var1: 'something'})`
 will automatically resolve the view and will inject the profiler object which
 needs to be finalized. This adds timers before and after the rendering as well
 as query timers for enhanced profiling. `res._r` contains the original render
 function if it is needed. The usage definition is not changed.
* Template variables now available. `_pageProfile` this is a result of the
 `Profiler` system. It contains an array of steps with times and messages that
 can be print used to build statistic footers. EG: 
 `<span>Page Generated in {{_pageProfile.totalTime}}ms, using
 {{_pageProfile.queryCount}}</span>`.
 Finally, `{{{_pageProfile.HTML}}}` is a new variable that contains an HTML
 formatted printout of the profile for use below the footer of the page.
* To make the query profiler work properly per page, there has to be a setting
 added to the queries in use in the controllers. EG: 
 `SomeModel.findByPk(someId,{logging: req.locals._profiler.addQuery})`.
 To shorten this you can use: `SomeModel.findByPk(someId,res.Q)` where
 `Q` stands for Query Options. Using this is optional.
* System level query profiling is also now in effect. In `config.dev = true` all
 queries will be logged to console unless they are passed to the page profiler.
* The profiling system can be activated by using the environment variable
 `NODE_DEBUG=kado`, this will enable the profiler and DEBUG logging. However, if
  you want permanent control over dev mode and the profiler setting the
  `config.dev` setting to `true` or `false` will override the environment.

### 3.4.10
